### File description:

The notebook Online Retail II takes the original dataset and resamples it to output three new datasets. One of them is TotalQuantityByHour.csv, which contains the total quantity of the sold products by hour.

The python notebook 'new dataset' takes the resampled dataset and outputs a new dataset newdf3 that contains only the dataset for the year 2011.

The python notebook 'Time Series Analysis', takes the newdf3 as input. It analyses the time-series data and uses tensorflow to perform an RNN forecast on it.
